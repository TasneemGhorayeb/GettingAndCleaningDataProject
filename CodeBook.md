StUDY DESIGN

Data retrieved and downloaded from the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.
Data set built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing basic activities and postural transitions while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
They captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz using the embedded accelerometer and gyroscope of the device.
The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

CODEBOOK

The dataset is cleaned and summerized from its original form to show the average of selected feautures for every subject participating in the project for every activity he/she made wearing the smartphone. 


"SubjectLabelId" 
        Number Id describing each user 
"ActivityLabel" 
        Factor describing each activity
        1 WALKING
        2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS
        3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
        4 SITTING
        5 STANDING
        6 LAYING

Below are averages for each subject doing an activity:
